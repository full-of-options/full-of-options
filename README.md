# About Me ðŸ‘‹


**full-of-options/full-of-options** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning GitHub in order to develop mobile webapps and models, loras, etc. for AI image generation software.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something new every day.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything that will provide me with an opportunity for personal growth and skills enhancement. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building my first repository.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my ideas for new apps and the book I'm trying to write.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me anytime.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm good at retaining useless facts such as dueling is Paraguay is legal as long as both parties are blood donors. I also love to foster animals, mostly dogs.
